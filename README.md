My implementation and extension of the dynamic emulation/calibration methodology of [(Liu &amp; West, 2009)](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mw/mwsoftware/DLMGASP/index.html), later applied by (Farah et al., 2014)[https://www.jstor.org/stable/24247380].

This methodology is the focus of my dissertation research. Within my work, I've extended this framework to build a statistical-mechanistic methdology to enable fast emulation and calibration to potentially misspecified systems of partial differential equations.
